# An example of how patterns are tried in order, whenever there is a "default"
# var pattern after a lit.

# Match Foo to 123, Bar to 456, and anything else to 789.
Foo -> 123
Bar -> 456
_   -> 789

# This pattern is redundant because the above three match first.
Foo -> 123

# For any Pattern of len `x`, at most `x` patterns will be tried. While there
# are four unique possible patterns, at least half are always eliminated each
# time a term is matched or not.
Foo Bar -> "asdf"
Foo _   -> "as"
_   Bar -> "df"
_   _   -> ""
