# How to match patterns of arbitrary length. It may be necessary for two elipses
# operators, for greedy and lazy matching. Simply requiring multiple patterns
# may be a better solution.

# This pattern matches any Pattern and applies it to itself. The result is one Pattern,
# not two (no parens were used).
... -> ... ...

# This pattern matches any Pattern starting with `Foo`
Foo ... -> 123

# Any Pattern ending with `Bar`
... Bar -> 456

# Any Pattern beginning and ending with the same ast
foo ... foo -> 789
