# Ideas on how to implement a non-builtin list type

# Make the empty list a concrete type, but with polymorphic elements
[] -> [] : List 0 _

# An alias to allow single term empty lists
[ ] -> []

# Translate [ 1, 2, 3 ] into 1 :> 2 :> 3 :> []
# Make commas operators
([ head ]) -> head :> [] # allow lists without trailing comma 
([ head , tail) -> head :> [ tail
